  <h1>Hi ! I am Michael!</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my website!</p>
  <img src="https://content.codecademy.com/articles/github-pages-via-web-app/happy-ice-cream.gif" />
  <p>I design and build intuitive user interfaces with a strong focus on
      user interaction and clarity.
      I’m good at spotting friction in UI and visualizing solutions before
      turning them into clean, structured code.
