    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>Professional Background</h2>
        <p>
            I am a former mechanical engineer with over five years of experience designing
            user-focused solutions, working with data, and translating complex technical
            problems into clear, practical outcomes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am now transitioning into front-end development, where I apply the same
            problem-solving mindset to building intuitive, accessible, and well-structured
            user interfaces.
